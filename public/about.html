            Hi! I'm a passionate web developer with experience in creating
            dynamic and engaging web applications. I enjoy working with HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript to build intuitive user interfaces. In my free
            time, I love playing cricket, reading books, and participating in
            coding competitions. My goal is to continuously learn and grow as a
            developer while contributing to innovative projects.
